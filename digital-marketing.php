                As 2018 progresses, the digital marketing landscape that encompasses SEO, social media, PPC, content marketing and more is witnessing a dramatic shift – which businesses can no longer ignore. There may have been a time when you could’ve dismissed artificial intelligence or visual search as gimmicks from the latest blockbuster science fiction film, but that time is long gone.There are many new digital marketing trends and strategies that are evolving in the current high-tech era and businesses now need to use them to succeed in their efforts. The key is to stay on top of the trends and figure out what is the best for your business today. What was worked for you in a previous year may not work this year as new trends continuously keep on emerging.
